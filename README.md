# Another Note App

Note app for CS 4750

`notes` contains the flutter project, `notes-firebase` contains firebase configuration settings and firebase functions.

## To run the flutter project:

Open the `notes` directory in Android studio, then run `main.dart` on the device of your choice.

## To run mock firebase features

Open the `notes-firebase` directory in command line of your choice, make sure you have firebase CLI tools installed. Do `npm install` then `firebase emulators:start`

By default, the flutter application will try to connect to an emulator first, then default to production server.
